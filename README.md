# VBLOCK
Free and easy tool to appear offline in Valorant!

HOW TO USE IT:

You can either open the exe file as an administrator, or you could open the shortcut.
After opening, just tap activate, to activate the tool!

IS IT A VIRUS?

No it isnt. Its totally safe and 100% written in python.
My pc detected it as a virus although I created it xD so your pc will probably do the same. Its probably going to say something like: This program executes harmful commands. But dont worry because all the program does, is executing commands to block being online in Valorant. If you dont trust me, you can check the source code!

I hope you enjoy my tool!

BTW: I set the shortcut to open as administrator every time, but if it doesnt open as administrator automatically, right click on it, then hit properties, then hit advanced at the bottom and activate run as administrator. Now, if yo open the app, it will run as administrator automatically.
To add it to your taskbar, you can simply open the app and richt click on the app icon on the task bar, and tap "pin to task bar".

You can move the shortcut anywhere on your pc. It doesnt matter, but dont move the VBLOCK.exe because it has to stay in that exact folder.
